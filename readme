1) I have completed the task using angular technology and shared the zip file.
2) Please do 'npm install' after extracting the zip file (as I have removed node modules folder) and then do 'ng serve' for executing the same.
3) I have used angular material for all the form fields, made all the form fields as required and I have used regular expressions for validating emailid and phone number.
4) I have also attached the demo video of this task for reference.
5) Hope, you liked my work. Thank you
